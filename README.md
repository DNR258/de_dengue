# Dengue cases in Argentine and the world
Data pipeline for Dengue data visualization

## Technologies
In this project I used:

- Terraform as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for cloud setup,
- Mage AI for orchestration,
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as data lake for data storage,
- Google BigQuery as Data Warehouse,
- dbt for the transformation of data the data,
- Google Looker studio for visualizations.

The data pipeline pulls Dengue data from two different sources, loads it into GCS and then into BigQuery using Mage. After that, the data is transformed inside the data warehouse with dbt, and visualized in Looker Studio:

## Problem Description
I choose two different data sources with the goal of build a detailed register of reported Dengue cases around the world with special emphasis on those registered on Argentine. One of the data sources has Dengue data from all over the world, but the Argentinian data is updated just until 2022. So, I decided to complete this data with public yearly data generated by the Argentinian Health authorities. Since the data corresponding to the current year is not available yet, the pipeline is going to be refreshed anually. Although it is posible to get the 2024 data, the available format of it difficult its extraction and processing, so it will be a future challenge. 

## Repository Structure
- dbt: all directories, .yml, .scl files, etc. for the transformations in dbt
- mage: .py and .sql files for the mage flows
- terraform: terraform files


## Do it yourself
To reproduce this pipeline just follow the instructions.
